## Description
<br><br>
In this project we are presenting the real time facial expression recognition of seven most basic human expressions: ANGER, DISGUST, FEAR, HAPPY, NEUTRAL SAD, SURPRISE.<br><br>
## Prerequisites
You need to have installed following softwares and libraries in your machine before running this project.
1. Python 3
2. Anaconda: It will install ipython notebook and most of the libraries which are needed like sklearn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, PIL.
3. OpenCV: Image processing library.
4. keras
## Installing
1. Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
3. OpenCV: ```pip3 install opencv-python```
4. Keras: ```pip3 install keras```
5. flask: ```pip3 install flask```

## Built With
* ipython-notebook - Python Text Editor
* OpenCV - It is used for processing images
* Keras - Deep Learning Library
* Sklearn: It is a Machine Learning library but here it is used just to calculate accuracy and confusion matrix.
* Flask: Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is a lightweight WSGI web application framework.
* Tensorflow: Model building, classsification and predictiong. Keras requires tensorflow.
